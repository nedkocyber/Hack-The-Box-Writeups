# Dog - Linux(Easy)

## Summary

Dog is an introductory Linux machine designed for beginners, offering a clear path from initial foothold to root. The machine begins with a publicly accessible Git repository containing sensitive information, which helps to gain access to a Backdrop CMS instance. This leads to remote code execution via file upload. Finally, privilege escalation is achieved through a misconfigured sudo command, allowing full root access.
